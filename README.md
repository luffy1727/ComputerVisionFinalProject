This is the readme file for the final project. 
# Paper:
The final paper and presentation can be found in their respective folders.
# Code:
Implementation of the model and the python script to run it can be found in Codes folder. 

In the Codes folder, you can find mask r-cnn implementation and coco tools inside the samples folder.
Inside the samples folder, there lies a demo python script to run the demo program provided from Mask RCNN github. It uses my trained weights to segment whatever is inside my_images folder.

Also, there lies visualize_cv.py python script which has opencv functions to run the model with your webcam for real time segmentation. 

You can see the model running on my webcam successfully in the screenshots folder.

In order to run the model, you have to have: 
Tensorflow, python and coco tools and this repo to be cloned.

# Conclusion :
I have achieved what i was hoping for which was to implement a model that can classify segments of images with accuracy 97 or higher. Moreover, I have used what i learned from this class which was to connect my webcam with the model, and creating a suitable functions for the arguments of the functions that feeds it to the model. For an undergraduate who worked alone on a project of this magnitude, I think i did pretty well.
